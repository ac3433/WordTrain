Controls:
Everything will be mouse-based action. 
	Left click: Drag and drop letter cards in the player hand onto or out of the play area.
	Right click: Return letter card back to hand.

Instructions:
The goal is to get as many points as possible by constructing words from the letter cards in your (digital) hand. Drag letter cards from the bottom panel to the top panel to construct words, then press "Go!" to validate the word. If it is valid, you get points based on the number of points in the word times the number of syllables. All cards in the top panel will then be removed except for the last one. You will need to construct a new word with that card as the first letter.
